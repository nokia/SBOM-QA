## Objectives of SBOM Quality Assurance
The SBOM Quality Assurance (SBOM QA) project aims to establish a benchmarking framework for evaluating open-source Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools. It focuses on:

- Assessing the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of SBOM generation tools.
- Generating SBOMs from a controlled set of open-source repositories.
- Comparing tool outputs against reference SBOMs derived from the GitHub dependency graphs of target projects.
- Providing actionable insights to improve transparency, security, and compliance in software supply chains.

For detailed project guidance, see the [SBOM-Quality-Assurance_Test](https://github.com/nokia/SBOM-QA/blob/main/DOC/SBOM-QA_Test.md).
